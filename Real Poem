This is called a **Poem**

In the sky so high, a wondrous sight,
A rainbow forms, its colors bright.
With hues that dance in radiant grace,
It paints a smile on every face.

First, a crimson red, bold and warm,
Like love's embrace in a gentle storm.
Next, a vibrant orange, full of zest,
A fiery sunset in the west.

Then comes yellow, like the morning sun,
Awakening a new day, just begun.
Green, like nature's soothing balm,
Brings a sense of calm and charm.

Blue, like oceans deep and wide,
A tranquil hue, where dreams reside.
Indigo, a midnight's velvet kiss,
Mysteries woven in its bliss.

Last of all, a violet's gentle sway,
With dreams and hopes in shades of gray.
A rainbow's promise, a hopeful song,
In its colors, we all belong.

So when you see a rainbow's arc,
Let it ignite your inner spark.
For in its beauty, we find our way,
Guided by the colors, come what may.
