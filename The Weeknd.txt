You've been scared of love and what it did to you
You don't have to run, I know what you've been through
Just a simple touch and it can set you free
We don't have to rush when you're alone with me
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, baby
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, baby
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, baby
I feel it coming, I feel it coming, baby
