Rainbows, rainbows, in the sky,
A brilliant arc that catches the eye,
With colors vibrant, bold, and bright,
A wondrous sight, a true delight.

Red, orange, yellow, green, and blue,
Indigo and violet, a rainbow's hue,
A symbol of hope, of peace, of love,
A message from the heavens above.

After the storm, the rainbow appears,
A promise of joy, to calm our fears,
So let us marvel at this beautiful sight,
And let its colors fill us with light.
