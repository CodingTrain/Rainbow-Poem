Poem that includes all of the reserved keywords in JavaScript.

```
Let this long package float, 
Goto private class if short.
While protected with debugger case,  
Continue volatile interface.
Instanceof super synchronized throw, 
Extends final export throws.  

Try import double enum?  
- False, boolean, abstract function, 
yield arguments eval await 
Implements typeof transient break!
Void static, default do,  
Switch int native new. 
Else, delete null public var 
In return for const, true, char
â€¦Finally catch byte.
```
