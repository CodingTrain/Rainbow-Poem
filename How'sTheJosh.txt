INDIAN ARMY PARADE SONG
Kadam Kadam Badhaye Jaa Khushi Ke Geet Gaye Jaa
Yeh Jindagi Hain Kaaum Ki Tu Kaaum Pe Lutaye Jaa

Tu Sher Hind Aage Badh, Bandhe Se Phir Bhi Tu Na Darr
Udake Dushmano Ka Sur, Jo De Watan Badhaye Ja


Kadam Kadam Badhaye Jaa Khushi Ke Geet Gaye Jaa
Yeh Jindagi Hain Kaaum Ki Tu Kaum Pe Lutaye Jaa
