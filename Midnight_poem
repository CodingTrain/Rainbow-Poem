It's a bit past midnight
work is too heavy and sleep too light
In a city full of people so so loud
I feel so alone when I go out
Its too close to be foreign
Too far to be home
Its hard to be happy, harder to be sane
When you feel so alone.
I realized long ago this is not somewhere I wanna be
I wannd go back home because there I was happy
Today was a little better
No
I hope it doesn't get worse
I is now a good letter
because its not selfish for her to ask for what is hers
Yeah
I am happy but sad too
