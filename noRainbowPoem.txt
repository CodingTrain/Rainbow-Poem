All good things come to an end,
Even the gifts that God sends,

Like her, the angel He sent from above
who was the one person I truly loved.

She changed everything and made my life worthwhile.
She was the only one who could make me smile.

She really doesn't understand how much she means.
I'll never be as happy as I've been.

She was my heart and my soul,
She filled me with joy and made me whole. 

She was my world, my greatest treasure. 
I loved her so much that it couldn't be measured. 

I remember every kiss and touch.
All our memories I miss so much.

I wish we could go back in time, 
When I was hers and she was mine.

I'd always protect her and let nothing harm her.
How ironic it was though that she was my armor. 

She always made me feel so secure.
No matter what went wrong, she always had a cure. 

With her I felt absolutely no fear,
But now I'm scared of anything that comes near.

She healed me and put me back together,
So I held on to her; she was my tether.

Sadly, she suddenly cut the rope,
And with it went my happiness and hope.

The spell had finally been broken 
As I realized I had awoken. 

It had all just been a dream, 
No matter how real it may have seemed. 

Everything I felt had been an illusion,
Explained by the way it left me in shock and confusion. 

My best dream became my worst nightmare. 
She vanished while she was right there. 

She left me to struggle on my own.
She left me stranded, isolated, and all alone.

I had to wake up and realize
That the only real truth are real lies.

But I can truly tell her, "You're the sweetest dream I ever had,"
And for that, I can only be grateful and glad.

To be happy again, I'll have to relive the past.
Hold on to every memory for as long as they last,

To look back at how I used to feel,
To remember them as if they were real.

Even though it's over, l'll have to pretend,
Because all good things must come to an end.
