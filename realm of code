In the realm of code and debug strife,
A bug appeared, causing much life.
Programmers laughed, typed with glee,
Syntax errors danced, wild and free.

But in the end, with lines refined,
Code prevailed, bugs left behind.
In the kingdom of bytes, a chuckle's decree,
May your programs run, error-free!
