All my life I lived in grey 
and black, 
blue and 
red.

Black was depression.
Grey was numbness.
Blue was sadness.
Red was anger.

Those were the colors, 
emotions of my life.

That was my rainbow...
that make me get rid of those


UNTIL I MET DAVE.
I AM ANGRY AF
Let me go make a sandwhich
for my greenish farts.
