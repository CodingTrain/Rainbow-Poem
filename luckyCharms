I can't eat rainbows,
But I can eat cereal,
Lucky Charms doesn't taste like a rainbow,
But they taste pretty damn good,
If they sue us,
Who gets the pot of gold?
- You get the pot of gold, hermano.

The PO-PO
If only lucky charms were in Australia...

I have never eaten Lucky Charms,
Nor am I a lawyer,
But because I have contributed to this poem,
I will be forked untill my hopes and dreams are over.
