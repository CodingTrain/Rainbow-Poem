Show kindness to others!
Treat all men as brothers,
Whatever their station, whatever betide;
All envy disdaining,
A failing discerning,
Seek not to uncover, but rather to hide.
Speak kindly to other,
And wealth shall be yours,
The magic of story still lives in kind words;
Let them be spoken,
And hearts will fly openâ€”
Kind words are ever more mighty than swords.
