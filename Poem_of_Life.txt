 *****  Beauty of Life *****


The beauty of life lies in each day,
In the moments that take our breath away,
In the warmth of the sun and the cool of the breeze,
In the rustle of leaves and the sway of the trees.

It's in the laughter of children and the love we share,
In the kindness we give and the burdens we bear,
In the colors of the rainbow and the stars up above,
In the simple joys that fill our hearts with love.

Life may have its struggles and its pain,
But it's the beauty that makes it all worth the gain,
For every day is a gift to cherish and hold,
A chance to see the beauty and watch it unfold.
