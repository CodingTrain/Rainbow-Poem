Poem about Red :

When the rainbow and tulip glee, the pigment is you.
When deep love either cherishes or perishes, the pigment is you.
Bride's cheek tinkle with laughter, the pigment is you.
When two brothers fight, rage has a color, the pigment is still you.
Almighty's bliss on my forehead, the pigment is you.
When the lustrous sun sets, the pigment is you.
My soldiers who bleed, the pigment is you.
Poor farmer cries over his burning crop, the pigment is you.
When the massacre hits my land, the pigment is you.
A woman sheds her femininity, the pigment is you.
Life gives both riches and tears, the pigment is always you.
Oh, thy red, you're the beauty of rose and my icy nose.
