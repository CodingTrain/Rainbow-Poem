In the land where rivers weave their tales,
Beneath the sun that never fails,
A tapestry of colors and sound,
In India's heart, stories abound.

Upon the soil where traditions stand,
In the vastness of this ancient land,
Whispers of history, echoes of time,
A rhythmic dance, a poetic rhyme.

Under the shade of banyan trees,
A symphony of winds through the leaves,
Sarees swirling in a graceful dance,
India's soul in every glance.

From the Himalayas' majestic peak,
To the shores where the oceans speak,
Diversity in every hue,
A kaleidoscope of red and blue.

In the bustling markets' vibrant maze,
Spices mingle in a fragrant haze,
Aromas wafting through the air,
A taste of India, rich and rare.

In the courtyard, a sacred flame,
Burning bright in devotion's name,
Temples standing tall and grand,
A spiritual journey through the land.

Amidst the chaos, a tranquil prayer,
A moment of peace, a breath of air,
Yoga's wisdom, ancient and true,
A union of mind, body, and soul to pursue.

In the moonlit night, a ghazal's song,
A poet's heart, where emotions throng,
Stars above in cosmic delight,
Painting dreams on the canvas of the night.

Through festivals that light the sky,
Diwali's sparkle, colors high,
Unity in diversity's embrace,
India's spirit, a timeless grace.

So here's to India, the land so vast,
A tapestry woven from the past,
In every corner, a story untold,
A timeless poem of silver and gold.
