Here's a poem on Rainbow

play with rainbow, wear the rainbow
ride the rainbow high and low
spread the color of rainbow whrver you go
paint with rainbow, create a magnificent show 
share rainbow with neighbour, family and friends
give the needy a helping hand, reach out and extend 
dance with rainbow, sing with rainbow 
let the rainbow shine through
