Here's a poem on Rainbow

Play with rainbow, wear the rainbow
Ride the rainbow high and low
Spread the color of rainbow whrver you go
Paint with rainbow, create a magnificent show 
Share rainbow with neighbour, family and friends
Give the needy a helping hand, reach out and extend 
Dance with rainbow, sing with rainbow 
Let the rainbow shine through
