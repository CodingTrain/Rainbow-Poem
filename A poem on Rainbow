Here's a poem about a Rainbow:

Play with the rainbow, wear the rainbow.
Ride the rainbow high and low.
Spread the color of the rainbow wherever you go.

Paint in rainbow, create a magnificent show.

Share the rainbow with neighbours, family and friends.
Give those in need a helping hand, reach out and extend.
Dance with the rainbow, sing with the rainbow.

Let the rainbow shine through.
