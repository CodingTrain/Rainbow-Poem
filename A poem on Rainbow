Here's a poem on Rainbow

play with the rainbow, wear the rainbow
ride the rainbow high and low
spread the color of the rainbow wherever you go
paint with rainbow, create a magnificent show 
Share the rainbow with neighbors,family, and friends
give the needy a helping hand, reach out, and extend 
dance with rainbow, sing with rainbow 
let the rainbow shine through
