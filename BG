Here is another test :)
And here is another one xD

Here is another one from Sheffield :) 
This is my first commit to this repository!

The morning rays of the Sun cling
On the upper bow of the Rainbow
Emerge after a moment ‘s dusk
Brown Pelicans and Western Gulls
Fly beneath the lower bow
That touches the water
Send fishes into hiding
