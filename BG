This is my first commit to this repository!

The morning rays of the Sun cling
On the upper bow of the Rainbow
Emerge after a moment‘s dusk
Brown Pelicans and Western Gulls
Fly beneath the lower bow
That touches the water
Send fishes into hiding

yayayaaaaayayayayayayayayayayayaayaayyaya
and birds chirping
And man to do caving 
What a world to live

The end
This is a beautiful poem
yes
