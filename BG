And here is another one xD
Here is another one from Sheffield :)
This is my first commit to this repository!

The morning rays of the Sun cling
On the upper bow of the Rainbow
Emerge after a moment â€˜s dusk
Brown Pelicans and Western Gulls
Fly beneath the lower bow
That touches the water
Send fishes into hiding

yayayaaaaayayayayayayayayayayayaayaayyaya
and birds chirping
And man to do caving

The end
This is a beautiful poem


Random words to test out the process
The hidden gem remains hidden
With a rainbow flying
Turtles also hiding
hello from los angeles
