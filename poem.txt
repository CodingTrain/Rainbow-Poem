Poem by tutorial watchers

Ceiling to the Stars
Up in the sky, where the stars shine bright,
That’s where I will be;
Enjoying the thrills of outer space,
And all there is to see.

To see the rainbow you need rain.
To get rain you need clouds.
(CuriousBlue)
github is good
p5js is great
using them together makes me concentrate

Chi desidera vedere l’arcobaleno, deve imparare ad amare la pioggia.
(Paulo Coelho)

Więc widziałem za oknem całą jaskrawość,
ale ciągle nie mogłem określić tego uczucia,
jakie odczuwałem, że widzę to wszystko:
całą jaskrawość.
Nie smutek, nie beznadzieja, nie strach,
nie przerażenie, nie obojętność i nie radość,
nie nadzieja, nie spokój i nie zachwyt,
nie uniesienie, ale co?
Co rozlewało się po mnie, jakie uczucie,
że dożyłem tej chwili, żeby dojść do tego
miejsca, żeby zobaczyć całą jaskrawość? :)

Who wants to see the rainbow, must learn to love the rain.

Like your videos, the rainbow is fleeting but will always be remembered.

Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.
It is snowy today,
hope I see a rainbow someday.

thanks buddy :P for the tutorial!-----
i think rainbow is very beautiful, and more importantly, your video is very good.

Hello from Paris, France, thank you for making such great content on YouTube

Hi, I'm from Morocco!

A day to smile and not to pout!
"I love Earth Day.", says Peter Pony.

Nice video! Very informative and funny! So nice to learn and laugh at the same time :) Happy Eeath Day!
"Today is 28th December 2016...!!!"
"Today is 7 March 2018!"
Today is sometimes Thursday.
I enjoy macaroni
Today it is raining
Yesterday was sunny skies.
here in Germany is very sunny
And tomorrow it will rain again.
Sailing in a sea of rainbows.
"Well I love the sea," sang the stupendous starfish.
Earth Day is my favorite color.

I am thirsty.
You are not yourself when you are thirsty, my friend.
Purple rain
tis not pink
tis not orange either
could be Blue
or maybe Green
Indigo children
Recycle!
Unicorns exist
Yellow river
purple rain
I only wanted to see you
bathing in the purple rain!
is not sullen
is not pain
this is dark, no?
darkness is relative
is not pink
is not orange either
is not brown like a beaver
indeed sang the stupendous starfish
and swam with the turtles and whales

I went to the bar and got a fever.
I only wanted to see you bathing in the shallow tide pool
Blue is cold but also cool!
Teal
Green is calm
Eel
Maroon five four three two one!
Purple is deep!
Lip balm
Brown
Gold
Indigo girls are singing

Earth day is a day
And I should say:
Clouds
Unicorn
And a large gorilla
....never forget the this. this. this., this. this. this. .......
I love rainbows!
Rainbows are the best things on the Earth!
I like the Earth day too!
And love rainbows to grew!
I said to myself.
Keep Calm and Carry On!
Yellow, the color of the best-known plasma sphere
Red, the color of passion
Green, the color of nature
Is the color of the year.
Red is hot
Indigo
Hear! Hear!
East or West Dannie is the best!
These are the colors of the rainbow.
And the rainbow coloured unicorn.
Pony, Pony, Pony...
All I can say is that my life is pretty plain
I like watchin' the puddles gather rainbow
unicorns have have horns and that ryhmes (no pun intended)
ponys are small baby horses
Peter Pony drinks a cup of oolong tea.
It tastes wonderful.
Wonderful to me.
There must have been some cicadas on those leaves, how lucky!
And the party, the invited everyone but me
Learning with shiffman is like looking at a beautiful rainbow everyday.
Like the rainbow after storm in New York the other day.
What should I say?
Unicorns exist.
And so do gorillas.
Everything else is fake news and demand a hug.
And so do you.
At the same time; in the same space?
only in Timbuktu.
After rain comes sun and in between the rainbow gets it done.
Let's dance!
The crumbling cookie!
Fun is fun!
Poets around the world
Roses are red, violets are blue.
Purple Reign
I like you too
Poems are wonderful land for mind
so no worry about the structure
Some other time
Pat should not be forgotten
Rainbow initial coordinates are: 11.5504° N, 92.2335° E
Fairies are real!
Happy ending
I cannot feel
Hello Governor
I've never seen a rainbow in Tokyo
Come to think of it I've never seen a rainbow at home either
I play with a yo yo
Love ur vids
Pot of gold
So I'm told
Box of Lucky Charms
Cumberland farms
Pony of poets
Horse of harpists
Hamburgers dancing at the meatball!!
Brown lawns are the "New" green lawns!
Too close to home...adddin
To be or not to be a unicorn!
Ai Lad, Unicorns are marvelous!!
Running through the clouds
making dreams come true
they all hear the train
coming to challenge their brains
Excellent thoughtful line.

All shadows will go away somewhen, somewhen.
They'll go away.

EVEN THO YOUR COLORS ARE DESATURIZED YOU ARE STILL A RAINBOW

Hey! Using this for my first pull request.
Please sir! I do not jest,
this is a problem that must be addressed.
Perhaps your feelings are supressed....
or this poem is just giving you a
cardiac arrest.

I like rainbows in the sky
They force me to ask the question "Why,
if the world holds such pleasures,
such life affirming treasures,
must I eat that mincemeat pie?"
Ick.
I just bought a box of tissues.

“Study while others are sleeping;

 William Arthur Ward



**********************************************
 To Night
Swiftly walk o’er the western wave,
Spirit of Night!
Out of the misty eastern cave,
Where, all the long and lone daylight,
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,
Which make thee terrible and dear–
Swift be thy flight!

Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,
Blind with thine hair the eyes of day;
Kiss her until she be wearied out,
Then wander o’er city, and sea, and land,
Touching all with thine opiate wand–
Come, long-sought!

When I arose and saw the dawn,
I sighed for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary day turned to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest,
I sighed for thee.

Thy brother Death came, and cried,
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,
Murmured like a noontide bee,
Shall I nestle near thy side?
Wouldst thou me?–And I replied,
No, not thee!

Life will come when thou art dead,
Soon, too soon–
Sleep will come when thou art fled;
Of neither would I ask the boon
I ask of thee, beloved Night–
Swift be thine approaching flight,
Come soon, soon!
what a beautiful day!
I like rainbow

I dig, you dig, we dig...
It is not a good poem,
But it is very deep.

 I feel like a toddler
Teetering and tottering as I take my first brave steps
Into the unknown.
We often fear what we do not understand,
But I think that instead we should try
And color our skin with hues that cannot be seen
In the standard visible spectrum.
We're making a rainbow connection,
You and I.

A unicorn per day keeps the doctor away !!! 



Early in the evening a song bird

Sitting on a branch was singing

It saw a glowing object on the ground

Considering it a fire fly flew down to it

The fire-fly said to the singing bird

"O singing bird, do not kill a helpless creature,


 Akoy isang pinoy sa pusot diwa

Pinoy na isinilang sa ating bansa

Akoy hindi sanay sa wikang mga banyaga

Akoy pinoy na mayroong sariling wika

Wikang pambansa ang gamit kong salita

Bayan kong sinilangan, hangad kong lagi ang kalayaan

Si Gat. Jose Rizal nooy nagwika

Siya ay nagpangaral sa ating bansa

Ang hindi raw magmahal sa sariling wika

Ay higit pa ang amoy sa mabahong isda

Wikang pambansa ang gamit kong salita

Bayan kong sinilangan, hangad kong lagi ang kalayaan

Akoy isang pinoy sa pusot diwa

 Roses are red

 Shiffman is the best coding teacher
 And that is really true.

 Cuz he's dope and isn't a stuck up douche.

Save trees
Stop using Tissues!

Mary had a rainbow lamb
rainbow lamb, rainbow lamb
Mary had a rainbow lamb
Its fleece was Roy G Biv
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go

He followed her to school one day
School one day, school one day
He followed her to school one day
Which was against the rule
It made the children laugh and play
Laugh and play, laugh and play
It made the children laugh and play
To see a lamb at school

And so the teacher turned him out
Turned him out, turned him out
And so the teacher turned him out
But still he lingered near
And waited patiently
Patiently, patiently
And wai-aited patiently
Til Mary did appear

Mary had a rainbow lamb
rainbow lamb, rainbow lamb
Mary had a rainbow lamb
Its fleece was Roy G Biv
And everywhere that Mary went
Mary went, Mary went
Everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go
