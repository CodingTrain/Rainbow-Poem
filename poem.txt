The Rainbow and the Unicorn and the Pony and don't forget the Singing Starfish!
hello!!!!!!!
good luck
Rainbows happen following rain when the sun comes out
Today is Earth Day.
"I love Earth Day.", says Peter Pony.
"TOdaaay is 28th December 2016...!!!"
Today is Thursday. 
I love Thursdays.
"Well I love the sea," sang the stupendous starfish.
Earth Day is my favorite color.
Purple rain
is not pink
is not orange either
indeed sang the stupendous starfish
and swam with the turtles and whales
I only wanted to see you bathing in the shallow tide pool
Blue is cold but also cool!
Teal
Green is calm
Maroon
Purple
Brown 
Indigo
Earth day is a day
Clouds
Unicorn
....never forget the This. this. this., this. this. this. .......
Keep Calm and Carry On!
Yellow, the color of the best-known plasma sphere
Red is hot
East or West Dannie is the best!
These are the colors of the rainbow.
And the rainbow coloured unicorn.
Pony:
Peter Pony drinks a cup of oolong tea.
It tastes wonderful.
There must have been some cicadas on those leaves, how lucky!
Learning with shiffman is like looking at a beautiful rainbow everyday.
Like the rainbow after storm in New York the other day.
Unicorns exist.
And so do you.
At the same time; in the same space?
only in Timbuktu.
After rain comes sun and in between the rainbow gets it done.
Let's dance!
The crumbling cookie!
Roses are red, violets are blue.
Purple Reign
Poems are wonderful land for mind
so no worry about the structure
Pat should not be forgotten
Rainbow initial coordinates are: 11.5504° N, 92.2335° E
Fairies are real!
Happy ending
