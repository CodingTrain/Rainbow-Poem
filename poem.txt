Learning github functionalities
The Rainbow and the Unicorn and the Pony and don't forget the Singing Starfish!
hello!!!!!!!
good luck
The starfish is a smart fish
Rainbows happen following rain when the sun comes out
Today is Earth Day.

Hello from Bozeman, Montana!

A day to smile and not to pout!
"I love Earth Day.", says Peter Pony.
"Today is 28th December 2016...!!!"
Today is sometimes Thursday. 
I enjoy macaroni
Today it is raining
Yesterday was sunny skies.
"Well I love the sea," sang the stupendous starfish.
Earth Day is my favorite color.
I am thirsty.
You are not yourself when you are thirsty, my friend. 
Purple rain
purple rain
I only wanted to see you
bathing in the purple rain!
is not sullen
is not pain
this is dark, no?
is not pink
is not orange either
is not brown like a beaver
indeed sang the stupendous starfish
I went to the bar and got a fever.
I only wanted to see you bathing in the shallow tide pool
Blue is cold but also cool!
Teal
Green is calm
Eel
Maroon
Purple
Lip balm
Brown 
Indigo
Earth day is a day
And I should say:
Clouds
Unicorn
....never forget the this. this. this., this. this. this. .......
I said to myself.
Keep Calm and Carry On!
Yellow, the color of the best-known plasma sphere
Is the color of the year.
Red is hot
Hear! Hear!
East or West Dannie is the best!
These are the colors of the rainbow.
And the rainbow coloured unicorn.
Pony
unicorns have have horns and that ryhmes (no pun intended)
ponys are small baby horses
Peter Pony drinks a cup of oolong tea.
It tastes wonderful.
Wonderful to me.
There must have been some cicadas on those leaves, how lucky!
And the party, the invited everyone but me
Learning with shiffman is like looking at a beautiful rainbow everyday.
Like the rainbow after storm in New York the other day.
What should I say?
Unicorns exist.
Everything else is fake news and demand a hug.
And so do you.
At the same time; in the same space?
only in Timbuktu.
After rain comes sun and in between the rainbow gets it done.
Let's dance!
The crumbling cookie!
Fun is fun!
Roses are red, violets are blue.
Purple Reign
I like you too
Poems are wonderful land for mind
so no worry about the structure
Some other time
Pat should not be forgotten
Rainbow initial coordinates are: 11.5504° N, 92.2335° E
Fairies are real!
Happy ending
I cannot feel
Hello Governor
I've never seen a rainbow in Tokyo
I play with a yo yo
Love ur vids
Pot of gold
So I'm told
Box of Lucky Charms
Cumberland farms
Pony of poets
Hamburgers dancing at the meatball!!
Brown lawns are the "New" green lawns!
Too close to home
To be or not to be a unicorn!
Ai Lad, Unicorns are marvelous!!
Running through the clouds
making dreams come true
they all hear the train
coming to challenge their brains


Party Hard!

>To find the end and the pot of gold
>Dang it



I like rainbows in the sky
They force me to ask the question "Why,
if the world holds such pleasures,
such life affirming treasures,
must I eat that mincemeat pie?"
Ick.
I just bought a box of tissues.

Rainbows lead to gold
Understanding git is worth it's weight in gold

I do not need drugs to be a genius;
I do not need to be genius to be human;
But I need your smile to be happy.
                       --Charles Chaplin

“Study while others are sleeping; 
work while others are loafing; 
prepare while others are playing; 
and dream while others are wishing.”

 William Arthur Ward
 
 
 
********************************************** 
 To Night
Swiftly walk o’er the western wave,
Spirit of Night!
Out of the misty eastern cave,
Where, all the long and lone daylight,
Thou wovest dreams of joy and fear,
Which make thee terrible and dear–
Swift be thy flight!

Wrap thy form in a mantle gray,
Star-inwrought!
Blind with thine hair the eyes of day;
Kiss her until she be wearied out,
Then wander o’er city, and sea, and land,
Touching all with thine opiate wand–
Come, long-sought!

When I arose and saw the dawn,
I sighed for thee;
When light rode high, and the dew was gone,
And noon lay heavy on flower and tree,
And the weary day turned to his rest,
Lingering like an unloved guest,
I sighed for thee.

Thy brother Death came, and cried,
Wouldst thou me?
Thy sweet child Sleep, the filmy-eyed,
Murmured like a noontide bee,
Shall I nestle near thy side?
Wouldst thou me?–And I replied,
No, not thee!

Death will come when thou art dead,
Soon, too soon–
Sleep will come when thou art fled;
Of neither would I ask the boon
I ask of thee, beloved Night–
Swift be thine approaching flight,
Come soon, soon!

- Percy Bysshe Shelley
