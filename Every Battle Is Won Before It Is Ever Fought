In order to set the stage for victory, you need to manage both your resources and your forces wisely. Preparation matters: Every battle is won before it is ever fought.

Wise Resource Management
One way a mishandling of resources leads to defeat is through extensive and exhaustive battles. Extensive and lengthy operations deplete your reserves. Thus, an intelligent leader will not keep his troops in the field for lengthy periods. 

Waging war is like igniting a fire. If the flame burns too hot for too long, it will burn itself out.
Similarly, engaging in extended battles without gain will exhaust your resources, including weapons, money, energy, and food.  This will weaken your troops and lead to loss.
Therefore, battles should be swift. Be big and bold, attacking quickly and ferociously, then retreating.
