Roses are red
Violets are blue
A+ for the poem
and CodingTrain too.

Red, and yellow and pink and green, purple and orange and blue
I can sing a rainbow.. . I sing a rainbow... and so can you.
Red, and yellow and pink and green, purple and orange and blue
I can dance a rainbow... I can dance a rainbow... and so can you.
