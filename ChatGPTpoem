AI Generated poem

In colors vibrant, a sight surreal,
The rainbow arcs, a joy to feel.
After the rain, it paints the sky,
A wondrous bridge, soaring high.

Red, the first, a fiery hue,
Passion and love it brings anew.
Orange follows, with warmth and cheer,
Like a glowing sun, drawing near.

Yellow shines, a burst of light,
Like fields of flowers, pure and bright.
Green emerges, nature's embrace,
A symbol of growth, in every space.

Blue appears, calmness it imparts,
Like peaceful seas, touching hearts.
Indigo captures mystery's allure,
A shade of dreams, deep and pure.

Violet crowns the arc above,
A regal hue, symbolizing love.
Oh, rainbow, a marvel of delight,
A colorful dance, enchanting sight.

Embrace its beauty, let it inspire,
A reminder of hope, never to tire.
For in its colors, a promise is seen,
That after every storm, beauty shall gleam.
