So this is my poem about my journey towards my goal to be a programmer (?)

----My Journey----
Java
i know you are useful
but i know you are not easy to grasp
and i know i should mastering you
but you know that im too lazy to remember all your syntax
maybe im not talented
but maybe im full of spirit
i actually know what should i do
and you know that i should do
this is my journey
end
