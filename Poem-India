No rainbows in the sky
No clouds trying to fly
No water around unless you cry
The heat over here will make you sigh

But lets forget all about that
I mean you can take care of the heat with a small hat
Lets create a program that will calculate your long and lat
And when taking breaks, play with the cat

Because we really enjoy riding the coding train
We like it more than a candy cane
Let's create some purple rain
or a simulation of a powerful crane

And when we're done we are super excited
Because we all love when the coding train's engine is ignited

No clouds and rains
No water till sun shine
I want to forget about all that
and i really enjoy riding on coding train
Because it is the coding train time.
Because when the train starts I cant stop
and when my dreams come true, I am gonna dance on hip hop like Mithun Da!
and do epic stuff!

I am an indian by heart
And coder by soul!

Thank you CODING TRAIN!

This is a very good poem and I want to admire it.

Hmm what are you expecting more about it Just close the document.

Ok then lets mess things much more than you actually think and lets see waht happens for that .
For a good start on git and guthub
it takes some pain,
nevertheless, just hop into the coding train.

India is my country
It is really a beautiful place
