A wonderful world of github
Hello World!

No rainbows in the sky
No clouds trying to fly
No water around unless you cry
The heat over here will make you sigh

But lets forget all about that
I mean you can take care of the heat with a small hat
Lets create a program that will calculate your long and lat
And when taking breaks, play with the cat

Because we really enjoy riding the coding train
We like it more than a candy cane
Let's create some purple rain
or a simulation of a powerful crane

And when we're done we are super excited
Because we all love when the coding train's engine is ignited

No clouds and rains
No water till sun shine
I want to forget about all that
and i really enjoy riding on coding train
Because it is the coding train time.
Because when the train starts I cant stop
and when my dreams come true, I am gonna dance on hip hop like Mithun Da!
Aissshhh!!!!!
and do epic stuff!

I am an indian by heart
And coder by soul!


Thank you CODING TRAIN!
from all of your indian fans!!!
I enjoy the ride of coding train :)
And coder by soul!
I love not only git but also github,
Lets go to the pub!
i wake up and say to coding what's up?
cause everday i am fully cheered up!
facing the hurdles with my chin up,
cause for me only way is up!
In India we say "Jai Ho!..
and I love the colours of rainbow! :D
:)

Sorry !!

This is a very good poem and I want to admire it.

Hmm what are you expecting more about it Just close the document.

Ok then lets mess things much more than you actually think and lets see waht happens for that .
For a good start on git and guthub
it takes some pain,
nevertheless, just hop into the coding train.

India is my country,
India is the largest democracy in the world,
It is the most diverse country in the world
It is really a beautiful place

i learn something about gihub
and now i feel like a god and i will learn even more
so thanks rainbowcoder for the hactober shirt
 Bharat Mata ki jay !!

aeeeeeeeeeeee halooo

Good to see the Two Together.

############ PAKISTAN POEM #########

pak pak pakistan
saf saf pakistan
her dum her pal azam hamara 
safeguard pakistan 
 heh :p
:))
I love math
Needs more comments about India. What do you think?

No clouds and rains
No water till sun shine
I want to forget about all that
Because it is the coding train time.
When the train starts I cant stop
and when my dreams come true, I am gonna dance on hip hop!
and do epic stuff!
I love the way you train
Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
Where knowledge is free
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
By narrow domestic walls

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Where words come out from the depth of truth
Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
Where the mind is led forward by thee
Into ever-widening thought and action
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country awake.
by Rabindranath Tagore

As we have Pakistan and India in the same poem I have an addition to make :
 
We have Sushma Swaraj, You have Heena Rabbani Khar.

We have Devanagri, You have Pharsi.

We have Arijit singh, You have Atif Aslam.

We have you, and you have us!
