In Rwanda's embrace, a land unfolds,  
Where beauty and resilience truly beholds.

With bustling streets where dreams thrive.

Guiding Rwanda's journey, shining so bright.

Nature's wonders grace this blessed land,  
Lakes and volcanoes, a sight so grand.  
Golden savannas and forests green,  
Where wildlife roams, a majestic scene.

A land of progress, where growth takes hold,  
Investments flourish, tales yet untold.  
Entrepreneurial spirit takes its flight,  
Empowering dreams, igniting the light.

Empowering minds, setting spirits free.

Warmth and kindness, an exquisite art.  
A tapestry of cultures woven tight,  
Celebrating diversity, shining bright.

Resilience echoes through the land,  
Transforming struggles, hand in hand.  
Through healing wounds, forgiveness blooms,  
Reconciliation's grace, the nation consumes.

In Rwanda's journey, a story unfolds,  
Of progress, hope, and love that molds.  
A nation's spirit, undying and true,  
Rwanda, a beacon, we look up to.
