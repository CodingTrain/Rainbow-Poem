From love, bitter becomes sweet.
From love, thorns become flower.
From love, vinegar becomes wine.
From love, fire becomes light.
From love, devil becomes angel.
From love, sorrow becomes joy.
From love, sickness becomes health.
From love, fury becomes mercy.
From love, dead becomes alive.
From love, King becomes servant.
With love from Rumi.
