8/3/2018 Love Love was the most important thing in our life. Love could make our lives become wonderful because it could make me get closer to others, make us have goals to achieve and make our lives full of moving. First, love could make us get closer. In the beginning I came to the US, I was very lonely because I did not speak English pretty well, I had no friends and I did not much about the US. I felt like I was separated from my classmates because they had been good friends

the love is always a love and we need to accept it as soon as possible.
