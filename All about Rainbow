# All about rainbow...

# Who discovered the rainbow?

The Greek philosopher Aristotle first started musing about rainbows and their colours back in 350 BC. His ideas were picked up and elaborated upon by the Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger in his Book 1 of Naturales Quaestiones around 65 AD. Senaca was surprisingly ahead of his time in his reasoning, even predicting the discovery of the prism effect by Newton centuries later.

# How are rainbows formed?

When sunlight hits a rain droplet, some of the light is reflected. The electromagnetic spectrum is made of light with many different wavelengths, and each is reflected at a different angle. Thus, spectrum is separated, producing a rainbow.

# Colours of Rainbow

The 7 colours of the Rainbow are:
RED
ORANGE
YELLOW

# How to remember the colours of the rainbow?

There is an easy way to remember them : VIBGYOR

These colours are the "visible" part of the sun's radiation. But there are many other parts that are not visible to the human eye. For example:
- immediately below red is "infraRED"
- immediately beyond violet is "ultraVIOLET" (UV)


# About the Frequency of Colours:
Red has the lowest frequency at the top of the arc, and violet has the highest frequency at the bottom of the arc. 


# About the Wavelenghth of Colours:

Red (the longest wavelength at around 780 nm) through to Violet (the shortest wavelength in the sequence at 380 nm).
