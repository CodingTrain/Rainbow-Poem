In lines of code, our passion flows,
With keystrokes quick and nimble prose.
Our minds alight with logic's grace,
A world of bytes we help create.

We craft and build with careful thought,
Our programs intricate and wrought.
We debug and test with patient care,
Our dedication beyond compare.

We find solutions to every woe,
Our skills expanding as we go.
From syntax errors to complex tasks,
We persist until the problem's passed.

For we are programmers, fierce and bright,
Our passion shining like the light.
Our hearts and minds forever bound,
To this world of code that we've found.

So let us code with all our might,
Our keyboards glowing in the night.
And in our work, let beauty show,
For we are programmers, and we glow.
