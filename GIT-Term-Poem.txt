1.1: Introduction - Git and GitHub for Poets

Step one--list goals:
this-is-a pedagogical poem.
pay attention to my lesson
don't do it all on your own.

When I type in ALL CAPS
you better open your mind
cause the TERM needs DEFINITION
so you can follow the guides.

So perk your eyes. re-espresso.
focus in. sit up straight.
Now that I have your attention
I can pre-educate:

    I do a FORK
    COMMIT some changes
    then I make a PR
    to the REPO
    served @ GITHUB
    running GIT
    from afar

Step two--define the terms
so you can gain a new skill:
to read and understand the manuals
without getting killed.

So what is GIT?

Simply put, GIT is version control
it keeps all changes
to your files
all without any toil.

So what is GITHUB?

It's a service where you get an account
A social network for git projects.
and it's all in the cloud.

STORY TIME!

I'm on GITHUB and I make a REPO
to hold my files and organize them
using GIT like a pro

Oh, no! REPO is a word I don't know!
Calm down, I'll define it, are you ready to go?

A REPO is short for a github repository;
a project or grouping of files--end expository.

Now why would you want this history maintained?
Cause you have too many versions
with the same filenames:
    underscore final dot txt (*_final.txt)
    and done best done dot D.O.C (*donebestdone.doc)

Not only for the selfish
GIT's collaborative too
To FORK is to copy
someone's GIT project for you

Make some changes to your copy
the you COMMIT them to save.
Let me explain with colors
to brighten your day:

Purple, Pink
Orange, Red, Blue
Green COMMIT is the button
to save changes new.

Add the color yellow
for another COMMIT.
the code keeps all former versions
a linear history in git

When you want to share your changes
with the project you FORKED
you do a PULL REQUEST
A.K.A. a PR
