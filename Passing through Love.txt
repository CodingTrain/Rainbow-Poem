
One day a butterfly flew in like a petal and gave me a tiny flutter.
There has been a time that I've read aloud the page that you read 
sitting in the chair you sat on, I've closed my eyes, in order to 
feel the warmt of your back against the cushion. I have even stroked 
my finger over the rim of the cup you drank from.

How did we traverse that long period between then and now?
Were we able to pass through love and arrive at love?

This miraculous inevitability, that I was able to stand
in front of you, was something that I didn't want to twist 
into mere coincidence.

Therefore, the best thing I can do is to try my best and...

...love you.
