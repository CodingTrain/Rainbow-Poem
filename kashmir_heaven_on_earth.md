It means that if there is paradise on this earth, this is it, this is it and this is it. It is impossible to overstate the beauty of Kashmir.
The breathtaking beauty of Kashmir has earned it the name of the “Switzerland of the East”. The gushing rivers, sparkling waterfalls, scenic surrounding and the lush green forests of Kashmir add to its splendour. Winter capital of Jammu and Kashmir state-Srinagar is famous for its Mughal Gardens, vast hillsides, laded with water scintillating water bodies and flanked with flowering shrubs and trees, laid in formal geometry by the grand Mughal emperors known for their legendary love for Kashmir valley.

> Shalimar Gardens are the outstanding among Srinagar’s many gardens and parks. This royal garden was laid out four hundred years ago by the Mughal emperor Jehangir for his wife’s sake. Nishat Bagh on Dal’s edge yet smaller than Shalimar, is more raptly beautiful, dotted with lofty Chinar plane trees.
The gardens of Chashma Shahi laid out by Shah Jahan is another irresistible spot which literally means - a mountain spring that waters it. Gulmarg, rightly called the ’meadow of flowers’ in Kashmir is famed for its golf course, the highest one in the world. The holy shrine of Amarnath, is in Pahalgam located on Lidder River, replete with trout fishes. Sonamarg harbouring many sites for camping is the base to exciting mountaineering expeditions to many lakes located on the high altitude.

> Like the paradise namely Kashmir those living in this paradise vale are too beautiful in looks, nature and attitude. The unparalleled feminine beauty of Kashmir surpasses the so-called tags like Miss-World or Miss Universe of modern times. Known for their intelligent and cool-tempered nature Kashmiris have made a niche for them across the country as well as abroad. Being the proud nativity of high-ups ranging from first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru to many icons in various walks of life including cinema.

> The two-decade long neighbour-sponsored militancy in the J&K particularly, Kashmir has virtually put this ‘Paradise on Earth’ on burning trail. The painful turmoil told upon the lives, scenic beauty as well as resources of the region. May God bring back the lost tranquility and peace to the Kashmir. Amen!
